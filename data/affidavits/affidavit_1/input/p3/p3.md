Subject: Generation and quoting of Document  Identification Number (DIN) on any communication issued by the officers of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to tax payers and other concerned persons- reg.

In keeping with the Government's objectives of transparency and accountability in indirect tax administration through widespread use of information technology, the CBIC is implementing a system for electronic (digital) generation of a Document Identification Number (DIN) for all communications sent by its offices to taxpayers and other concerned persons. To begin with; the DIN would be used for search authorization; summons; arrest memo; inspection notices and letters issued in the course of any enquiry. This measure would create a digital   directory for maintaining a proper audit trail of such communication. Importantly; it would provide the recipients of such communication a digital facility to ascertain their genuineness. Subsequently, the DIN would be extended to other communications. Also; there is a plan to have the communication itself bearing the DIN generated from the system.
